# Timetrap Amersfooort

While, unfortunately, not totally finished, this was my groups' finishing project for computer science. We had a whole school year for one final project, that consisted of 1 code environment, and $\frac{3}{4}$ year of preparing for the code environment. This was made up of milestones which were in turn made up of assignments like creating a systems concept, program of requirements, relational model, and testing the full system when it was done. The whole year was 75% writing about and preparing for the eventual code, and less than 25% actual writing code, the latter of which were done by me, [and 1 other](https://github.com/Luuk-Dev).

The plan was to make a game, that would teach the players about the history of Amersfoort, while remaining interactive and fun to play. In the end, it should be playable by GPS signal, so players can walk around in the city and are able to view landmarks as they are in the current day. Obviously this was only a "like to have" function, so we were not able to implement this just yet. We reached out to different cities close to our school, but none responded, or only responded by recommending us to get into talks with the museum. Because the project was so large and had relatively little time compared to the amount of assignments, we were unable to follow up on this recommendation.
